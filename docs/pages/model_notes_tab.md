![The overview of the model tabs](../images/notes_tab_models_overview.png)

Allows editing notes for the supported models.
Currently the following models are supported:

- Textual Inversion
- Hypernetworks
- Checkpoints
- LoRA

Select a Model tab of your choosing, select a model from the Dropdown and edit your note.

If Markdown is enabled then you need to press the `Edit Markdown ‚úèÔ∏è` button to edit the note, you are then presented with a markdown editor and a preview of the written markdown.

Get the description from [Civitai](https://civitai.com) by pressing the `Get description from Civitai` which will replace the existing note if it exists.

```{note}
Model Notes are only saved if you press the `Save üíæ` Button or automatically if autosaving is enabled in the Settings!
```

![Overview of the civitai tab](../images/notes_tab_civitai_overview.png)

In this tab notes can be downloaded from [civitai](https://civitai.com) descriptions and preview images from [civitai](https://civitai.com) previews.

### Models

Any overwritten notes cannot be recovered, unless you have a backup!
```

### Convert Html to Markdown

![The checkbox to convert html to markdown](../images/notes_tab_civitai_convert_html.png)

If checked then it will try to convert the html tags to markdown. This will should preserve any formatting, like **bold** or *italic* text, [links](https://github.com/lpawlick/sd-webui-model-notes) or images. Otherwise any html tags will be stripped and only the raw text will be kept.

```{note}
This option is only available if markdown support is enabled in the settings!
```

### Download preview image from Civitai

![The checkbox to download the preview image from civitai](../images/notes_tab_civitai_dl_preview.png)

If checked then it will download the preview image, which is shown in the extra networks tab, from civitai. It will download the first image from the `images` field returned by [this](https://github.com/civitai/civitai/wiki/REST-API-Reference#get-apiv1models-versionsby-hashhash) Civitai endpoint.

### Overwrite existing preview images

![The checkbox if the preview images should be overwritten](../images/notes_tab_civitai_overwrite_preview.png)

### Download Result

![The output from the notes download](../images/notes_tab_civitai_result.png)

Shows a progressbar and the statistics of the download once finished.
First it lists the model type the statistics apply to, then how many descriptions were downloaded, how many were skipped and how many failed. If downloading previews was enabled then it will show the same information about the previews.
A successful download is a note or preview that was downloaded and saved without any exception. A download was skipped when the selected options prevented it from being downloaded, for example when a note already exists and the overwrite option was not selected. A downloaded failed if either the model was not found on civitai or if the model has no descriptions or preview image.
If an exception occurs then the download will be aborted and the exception will be shown in the console.
